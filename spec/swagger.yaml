  title: Thing FSM - API for  allowing IoT devices to notify service management software of faults
  description: >-
    API specification to allow IoT platforms to push IoT device service alerts and faults to FSM software. Created as an open standard.
    
    
    This documents a set of endpoints which should be exposed by the service management software, however does not dictate how the events should be processed by the FSM software, or if a job should be raised. 
    
    
    IoT platforms can implement web-hooks which corrispond to this API in order to transfer events to FSM software in a standardised way.
    
    
    Definitions:
      - **FSM** - The field service management software, we refer to this as the API holder.
      - **IoT Platform** - The IoT platform which wishes to send events to the FSM software.
    
    Created by [ZConnect](https://zconnect.io) for the good of the industry.

      description: >-
        When there has been a fault detected with a machine, a new event can be raised by the IoT platform to allow this to be acted upon in the FSM software. This will generate a HTTPS request to the FSM servers on this URL to indicate that a fault has been detected.


        The response to one of these requests should indicate if a new or existing job has been linked to this event and give some relevant information which will aid users of the IoT platform in accessing the information in FSM software.
        
        
        The event is sent by the IoT platfom. Currently this is just a description an an event type which may be used to raise a new job for that event, however in future this will be expanded to allow reporting metadata, such as the component which has failed etc. It's the responsibility of the FSM software to decide if a new job should be raised, which is likely to be as simple as only raising jobs for the more severe `event_type` values.
